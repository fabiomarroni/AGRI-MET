# AGRI-MET

This repository contains scripts and R functions used for the AGRI-MET paper.

The aim of the work is to define a detection threshold for positivity when assessing the presence of viruses in *Vitis vinifera* plants.

The method *may* work as it is on other organisms, or it *may* need some adjustments.

You might need to install specific software to run some of the scripts.

The folder faidx_to_gff contains a one-click working example of the script with toy data of the script to greate a simplified viral gff. 

The folder scripts contains all the shell and perl scripts used in the (future) paper.

The functions scripts contains all the R functions used in the (future) paper. All the functions are called from the shell scripts.

I tried to document everything clearly, but you may need some tweaking with software paths and or your own data. 

The paper with the results of these analysis is currently under consideration for publication from [Archives of Virology](https://www.springer.com/journal/705?gclid=Cj0KCQjw-_j1BRDkARIsAJcfmTGxS6L6ca89fLIqkFdeXIb-Rh5b7Fde2TEdwcXyINNizXhhxGQcgrYaAuokEALw_wcB).
