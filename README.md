# AGRI-MET

This repository contains scripts and R functions used for the "AGRI-MET" paper published in Journal of Virological Methods (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2021.114383). The aim of the work is to define a detection threshold for positivity when assessing the presence of viruses in *Vitis vinifera* plants using total and small RNA-seq data.

You might need to install specific software to run some of the scripts. 

The *scripts* folder contains all the shell and perl scripts used in the (future) paper. The *functions* folder contains all the R functions used in the (future) paper. All the functions can be called from the shell scripts.

I tried to document everything, but you may need some tweaking with software, paths and/or strutcutre and location of your own data.

**NOTE**: The folder faidx_to_gff contains a working example and toy data set of the R function used to create a simplified viral gff (I thought it was the only thing that deserved such attention).
