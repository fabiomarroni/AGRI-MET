# AGRI-MET

This repository contains scripts and R functions used for the AGRI-MET paper.

The aim of the work is to define a detection threshold for positivity when assessing the presence of Virus in Vitis vinifera plants.

The method *may* work as it is on other organisms, or it *may* need some adjustments.

You might need to install specific software to run some of the scripts.
